        <p>
          I'm a passionate front-end web developer specializing in modern JavaScript frameworks and performance-driven design. With expertise in React, Tailwind CSS, and Vite, I build sleek, responsive, and fast-loading websites that prioritize both aesthetics and functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
          I focus on writing well-organized code and building layouts that are easy to maintain. My development process includes mobile-first design, smooth animations, and making sure everything works perfectly for the user. I care deeply about the small details that make websites look polished and feel great to use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with design and development, I also know how to improve websites for search engines (SEO). I use good HTML structure, meta tags, and image optimization to help sites rank higher and load faster. I also use tools like Google Analytics, Search Console, and Lighthouse to track performance and make improvements over time.
        </p>

        <p>
         I enjoy working with designers, content creators, and backend developers to bring ideas to life. Whether it's a personal website, a shop, or a full web app, I aim to build high-quality solutions that are fast, easy to use, and optimized for both people and search engines.
